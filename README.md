# Pharmacy claims
Using SQL to answer business questions about pharmacy claims
## ðŸ“Œ Overview
### Business needs

The client is an insurance company interested in setting up a test database before the data wareshouse goes live in production , along with pre-program along with pre-program SQL queries for future analysis and reportings. The developer is given a small sample dataset containing a list of pharmacy claims records.(see photo below - click to expand image)

### Normalization 

<img width="573" alt="raw dataset" src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellokatechan/pharmacy_claims_SQL/main/MARKDOWNS/raw_data.png>

The raw sample dataset was in its zero normal form because there were multiple entitles/tables nested under one sheet. Each row represents a pharmacy claim transaction containing the name of the patient, the name of the medication filled and billing information. To normalize the dataset from zero normal form to 1NF, I looked for immediate entities, table and keys.

#### 1NF and primary key set up 
An entity is the logical aspect of the database, whereas a table is the physical aspect of the database. A table represents a part of the business function that links to a different part of the organization. The four immediate entities that jumped out were members, drugs, copays, and insurance. I then assigned each attribute from the raw dataset to one of the four entities (i.e., memeber_id would be under the member table). 

The last component for the database in its 1NF is the primary and foreign keys. Each transactional row must contain a unique identifier. Below are the immediate attributes that qualify to be the unique identifier or primary key for its table: 

1. Member_id is the primary key for each patient under the member table. In this example, the primary key is a natural key because the unique identifier was already there in the raw dataset.
2. Drug_NDC is the primary key for each medication under the drug table. In this example, the primary key is a natural key because the unique identifier was already there in the raw dataset.
3. Drug_form_code is the primary key for each drug form under the drug table. In this example, the primary key is a natural key because the unique identifier was already there in the raw dataset.
4. Drug_brand_generic_code is the primary key for drug brand form under the drug table. In this example, the primary key is a natural key because the unique identifier was already there in the raw dataset.

A total of two primary keys emerged under the drug table. For each table to be in its 2NF, there shouldn't be any hidden entities. I broke the drug table into two new tables - drug_form and drug_brand_generic_code. 

Lastly, I created a new fill table, which contains billing information such as copays and insurance paid with fill_id as the primary key. 
In this example, the primary key is a surrogate key because I had to make up a unique identifier for the table. The FILL_ID doesn't have any business, so FILL_ID is a surrogate key.

#### 2NF and 3NF
After the transformation, each table was in its 3NF. There were no hidden entities, no functional dependencies, and attributes depending on its primary key.

#### Fact table (i.e. fill table)

The grain of the fill table is that each row in the transaction fact table represents a record of prescription fill.

COPAY_AMOUNT and INSURANCE_PAID are facts, while FILL_DATE is a dimension. COPAY_AMOUNT is an additive fact because I can add them up with the FILL_DATE dimension (what is the total copay amount for all the dates?). INSURANCE_PAID is also an additive fact because I can add up insurance paid for all the dates or selected dates.

### Foreign keys, CASCADE, SET NULL or RESTRICT 

The image above shows an ERD in the form of a star schema. Much like a star structure, the fill table is the centerpiece where it connects to the rest of the tables and vice versa with foreign keys. Each foreign key acts as a connector between the tables, where each foreign key is the primary key in the dimension table. 
All four foreign keys reside in the fill table: MEMBER_ID, DRUG_NDC, DRUG_FROM_COD, and EDRUG_BRAND_GENERIC_CODE.

* MEMBER_ID is a foreign key infill table because Iâ€™d like to know whose drug it belongs to for the prescription filled. 
* DRUG_NDC is a foreign key in the fill table because I can refer the NDC number to know which medication is filled. 
* DRUG_FORM_CODE is a foreign key in the fill table because I can refer to the code and know the medication's form. 
* DRUG_BRAND_GENERIC_CODE is a foreign key in the FILL table because I can refer to the DRUG_BRAND_GENERIC_CODE table to know if the medication filled is a brand name or generic name.

CASCADE, SET NULL, and RESTRICT are options for dealing with changes when there is an update or deletion in the parent table. CASCADE is used when you want to roll over the changes in the child table when there is an update or deletion in the parent table. SET NULL means that where there's an update or deletion in the parent table, the child table will change the values to NULL. The most restricted kind would be the RESTRICT, where no change would happen in the child table if thereâ€™s an update or deletion in the parent table.

Before deciding which option to go with for each foreign key, it is essential to determine which lowly changing dimensions(Type 0,1,2 and 3) to go with for the database. Type 2 is appropriate for the business use case because I don't want to overwrite any changes in the dimension table. Instead, a new row is created to capture the latest information while preserving the historical record. For example, if there's a change in drug form, I would like to keep the history of the fill transaction. 

Now that I know how to deal with information changes in the dimension tables, CASCADE is the option that best matches Type 2 for all foreign keys. 

### Sample queries
#### 1
The client is interested in having a few sample queries ready before the database goes live. Below are some commonly asked questions from across different business function. 

<img width="573" alt="raw dataset" src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellokatechan/pharmacy_claims_SQL/main/MARKDOWNS/num_rx.png>

Above is a SQL query that answers *how many prescriptions were filled for the drug Ambien?* - Answer: 5. 

<img width="573" alt="raw dataset" src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellokatechan/pharmacy_claims_SQL/main/MARKDOWNS/num_rx_ans.png> 

I started by looking at the tables that contained the information. I would need the name of the medication and prescription transaction The fact table and drug table contain the information I need to answer the business question. 

The drugs table left join the fact table on drug_ndc would result in a larger table with all the information needed to answer the business question. The COUNT and GROUP BY function would show the total number of a particular medication filled.

I can also further refine the filter by adding the WHERE clause. For example, *how many prescriptions were filled for the drug Ambien after 2017-01-01?* In which case, I would add the following WHERE clause to the query: 

```
SELECT COUNT(`fact_fill`.`DRUG_NDC`), DRUG_NAME
FROM dim_drugs
LEFT JOIN fact_fill ON `dim_drugs`.`DRUG_NDC` = `fact_fill`.`DRUG_NDC`
WHERE fill_date > 2017-01-01
GROUP BY DRUG_NAME;

```
#### 2 
The following SQL query is set up to questions like *how many unique members are over 65 years of age? Answer: 2* and *how many prescriptions did they fill? Answer: 7*

<img width="573" alt="raw dataset" src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellokatechan/pharmacy_claims_SQL/main/MARKDOWNS/case_logic.png>

From the SELECT statement, I listed out all the attributes that I wanted to see from the query output: 
* member_id
* age
* the total number of prescriptions filled
* the total amount of copay
* the total amount of insurance paid 
* day of birth 

I then look for the tables that contain the information I listed above - fact table and members table. The fact table left join the members table on member_id, resulting in a larger table with all the information I need in the output.  

<img width="573" alt="raw dataset" src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellokatechan/pharmacy_claims_SQL/main/MARKDOWNS/case_logic_ans.png>

Next, I used the CASE statement to group the members by their age into two buckets - 65+ or 65-. 

Case statement is equivalent to if...then..else statement. In SQL it is in the form of case...then...else, which translates to case year is less than 1980 then 65+ and when case year is greater than 1980 then 65-.I nested the CASE statement under the SELECT in the form of subquery. The output of the subquery would already assign the memebers into one of the two buckets. 

Once all the members is assigned to their age group category, I add the rest of the information I want in the SELECT statement:

* total number of prescriptions filled
* total amount of copay
* total amount of insurance paid 
* total number of unique members by age group

The query ends with a GROUP BY, which would bucket all the output by age group category.

#### 3

The following SQL query is set up to questions like *For member ID 10003, what was the drug name listed on their most recent fill date? Answer: Ambien* and *how much did their insurance pay for the medication? Answer: $322*

To reduce confusion, I created multiple tables. 


<img width="573" alt="table" src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellokatechan/pharmacy_claims_SQL/main/MARKDOWNS/lead_lag_1.png> 

The first table, Q4c_V1, is a left join between drugs and fact table. The table ouput shows fill_date, drug_name, insurance_paid, and member_id. 

<img width="573" alt="output" src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellokatechan/pharmacy_claims_SQL/main/MARKDOWNS/lead_lag_ans1.png>

The missing information such as member_first_name and member_last_name would lead a new table with a left join between Q4c_V1 and the member table. 

<img width="573" alt="table" src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellokatechan/pharmacy_claims_SQL/main/MARKDOWNS/lead_lag_2.png>

<img width="573" alt="table" src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellokatechan/pharmacy_claims_SQL/main/MARKDOWNS/lead_lag_ans2.png>

The output of the new table Q4c_V2 contain all the information needed to answer the business questions listed above. The next few steps were to refine the query so that I can identify the latest fill transaction per member.

<img width="573" alt="table" src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellokatechan/pharmacy_claims_SQL/main/MARKDOWNS/lead_lag_3.png>

The output of this query should contain all the attributes listed in the previous tables, which is why I used * in the SELECT statement. I also all a new field called FLAG using 
     
```
SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY member_id ORDER BY member_id, fill_date DESC) AS FLAG
```
PARTITION BY allows me to bucket all the members by its member_id, and within each bucket, order the fill_date in its descending order, latest date on top. The latest prescription fill will be labeled as 1 and so on. 

<img width="573" alt="table" src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellokatechan/pharmacy_claims_SQL/main/MARKDOWNS/lead_lag_ans3.png>

The idea behind FLAG is so that I can use the WHERE clause to filter out latest prescription fill per member. 

<img width="573" alt="table" src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellokatechan/pharmacy_claims_SQL/main/MARKDOWNS/lead_lag_4.png>

The final output of the query shows a list of the latest prescription fill per member.

### What's next?
Each insurance product has a different cap on maximum out of pocket per year. Members can deduct their copay from the maximum out of pocket amount. Once members have reached the maximum out of pocket amount, the insurance would pay all medication cost. The client would like to add the additional information about insurance products and its maximum out of pocket amount.

For this business use case, I would add a new table called insurance where it contains the following attributes:
* insurance_product_id as the primary key and foreign key in the fill table
* max_amount 

Fill table can left join insurance table on insurance_product_id and find out how much copays a member have paid so far compared to her maximum out of pocket amount. It would also be interesting to find out which members tend to reach their maximum out of pocket amount - helpful for the financial department to budget.
