# Pharmacy claims
Using SQL to answer business questions about pharmacy claims
## ðŸ“Œ Overview
### Business needs

The client is an insurance company interested in setting up a test database before the data wareshouse goes live in production , along with pre-program along with pre-program SQL queries for future analysis and reportings. The developer is given a small sample dataset containing a list of pharmacy claims records.(see photo below - click to expand image)

### Normalization

The raw sample dataset was in its zero normal form because there were multiple entitles/tables nested under one sheet. Each row represents a pharmacy claim transaction containing the name of the patient, the name of the medication filled and billing information. To normalize the dataset from zero normal form to 1NF, I looked for immediate entities, table and keys.

#### 1NF and primary key set up 
An entity is can be thought of the logical aspect of the database where as a table is the physical ascept of the database. A table represents a part of the business function that also links to different part of the organization. The four immediate entities that jump out were members, drugs, copays and insurance paid. I then assigned each attribute from the raw dataset to one of the four entities (i.e. memeber_id would be under the member table). 

The last component for the database to be in its 1NF are primary and foriegn key. To be a primary key, it must contain an unique identifer for each transactional row. Below are the immediate attributes that qualify to be the unique identify or primary key for its table: 

1. Member_id is the primary key for each patient under the member table. In this example, the primary key is a natural key because the unique identifier was already there in the raw dataset.
2. Drug_NDC is the primary key for each medication under the drug table. In this example, the primary key is a natural key because the unique identifier was already there in the raw dataset.
3. Drug_form_code is the primary key for each drug form under the drug table. In this example, the primary key is a natural key because the unique identifier was already there in the raw dataset.
4. Drug_brand_generic_code is the primary key for drug brand form under the drug table. In this example, the primary key is a natural key because the unique identifier was already there in the raw dataset.

A total of two primary keys emerged under the drug table. To reach 2NF there shouldn't be any hidden entities,for that,I broke the drug table into two new tables - drug_form and drug_brand_generic_code. 

Lastly, I created a new table called fill which contains billing information such as copays and insurance paid with fill_id as the primary key. 
In this example, the primary key is a surrogate key because I had to make up an unique identifier for the table. The FILL_ID donâ€™t have any business meaning making FILL_ID as a surrogate key.

#### 2NF and 3NF
After the transformation, each table was in its 3NF. There were no hidden entities in the form of composite keys, no functional depencies and lastly all attribute depend on its primary key. 

#### Fact table (i.e. fill table)

The grain of the fill table is that each row in the transaction fact table represents a record of prescription fill.

COPAY_AMOUNT and INSURANCE_PAID are facts while FILL_DATE is a dimension. COPAY_AMOUNT is an additive fact because it make sense to add them up with the FILL_DATE dimension (what is the total copay amount for all the dates?). INSURANCE_PAID is also an additive fact because we can find useful information if we were to add up insurance paid for all the dates or selective dates.

### Foreign key set up

</summary>

* Flawlessly converts raw data into a set of complete and error-free relational tables that meet all 3NF standards. Tables should be either a complete fact or a complete dimensional table.

* Uploads data and creates a complete and error-free star schema in MySQL. Clearly designates the primary and foreign keys. Fully explains in detail the choice to create a primary key as a natural key or a surrogate key using the SQL code. Explains in detail the specific MySQL action with the FKs in case of DELETION or UPDATE. Further select either CASCADE, SET NULL, or RESTRICT for each of the FKs.

* Draws an Entity-Relationship Diagram of your star schema fact and dimension tables. Accurately identifies all the joins types, primary keys, and foreign keys in all of the needed tables.

* Asks appropriate, in-depth and insightful questions to solve a business case. Creates relevant, clear and concise sample queries using SQL. Filters data in the correct format using lead and/or lag functions.
